                     Yet another General Purpose library
                     ===================================


Some generally usefull classes; ; separated in a common part (subdir Common),
designed to be independent of the used operating system or (GUI)
library/system and in parts specific to such things (subdirs CORBA, Windows,
X-windows).

Up to 3 libraries are created:

  - libYGP ..... Consists of generell purpose classes without dependency to
                 the used/installed operating system/library.
  - libXGP ..... Classes for the X-windows system; basing on gtkmm/gtk+ (only
                 made when a proper installation of gtkmm (formerly known as
                 Gtk--) is found).
  - libCGP ..... Classes to be used with CORBA (only made when a CORBA-
                 implementation (MICO) is found).


The whole thing is:

Installation
-------------

See the file INSTALL


Documentation
-------------

Can be found in the doc-subdirectory; In HTML-format; the file index.html is a
good starting point.

Note that you have to generate the documentation first (type `make doc` in the
doc subdirectory. You'll need doxygen for that (see and/or get it from
www.doxygen.org)).


Samples
-------

Both the CORBA and the Common section contain a Test subdirectory with some
files demonstrating the intended usage (though the main purpose is the test of
the classes).

The X-windows subdirectory has a Samples directory with a sample application.


Structure
---------

   - YGP:     Contains common classes of general interest.
   - CGP:     Classes and other stuff related to CORBA.
   - Windows: Classes and other stuff related to M$ Windoze.
   - XGP:     Classes and other stuff related to X-windows.
   - doc:     Documentation
   - intl:    Library for I18n
   - po:      Translations of the messages
   - bin:     Utilities; Helper scripts


How to report bugs and/or send patches
--------------------------------------

Bug reports and patches should be send to the e-mail address of the author (me)
(g17m0@lycos.com).

Please include for bugs:

  - The version of the library.
  - How to reproduce the bug.
  - In case of a crash (and if you used the IVIOApplication or XApplication-
    classes) there should also be a stackdump in your systemlog which might
    help in localizing the bug.
  - Anything else you think might be helpful.

Please note that I don't (can't) check my mails daily, so please be patient.
