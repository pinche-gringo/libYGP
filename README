                     General Purpose Classes
                     =======================


General purpose classes (separated in a common part (subdir Common), designed
to be independent of the used operating system or (GUI) library/system and in
parts specific to such things (subdirs CORBA, Windows, X-windows)).


Up to 3 libraries are created:

  - libAttr .... Consists of generell purpose classes without dependency to
                 the used/installed operating system/library
  - libXAppl ... Classes for the X-windows system; basing on gtkmm/gtk+ (only
                 made when a proper installation of gtkmm (formerly known as
                 Gtk--) is found)
  - libCAttr ... Classes to be used with CORBA (only made when a CORBA-
                 implementation is found)


The whole thing is:

How to report bugs and/or send patches
--------------------------------------

Bug reports and patches should be send to the e-mail address of the author
(g17m0@lycos.com) Don't tell him that this address sounds like the name of a
robot and/or sucks!

Please include

  - The version of the library.
  - How to reproduce the bug.
  - In case of a crash (and if you used the IVIOApplication or XApplication-
    classes) there should also be a stackdump in your systemlog which might
    help in localizing the bug.
  - Anything else you think might be helpful.

Please note that I don't (can't) check my mails daily, so please be patient.
